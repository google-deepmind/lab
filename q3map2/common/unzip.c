     The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
  (deflation) but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same
  stream interface.

     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
  enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed), or can be done by
  repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the
  application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

     The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio.

     The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never
  crash even in case of corrupted input.
*/

/*
   The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has
   dropped to zero. It must update next_out and avail_out when avail_out
   has dropped to zero. The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and
   opaque before calling the init function. All other fields are set by the
   compression library and must not be updated by the application.

   The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree. This can be useful for custom
   memory management. The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

   zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If zlib is used in a multi-threaded application, zalloc and zfree must be
   thread safe.

   On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this
   if the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h). WARNING: On MSDOS,
   pointers returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must*
   have their offset normalized to zero. The default allocation function
   provided by this library ensures this (see zutil.c). To reduce memory
   requirements and avoid any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of
   compression ratio, compile the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

   The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or
   progress reports. After compression, total_in holds the total size of
   the uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor
   (particularly if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in
   a single step).

int deflate OF((z_streamp strm, int flush));
/*
    deflate compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may introduce some
  output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

    The detailed semantics are as follows. deflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly. This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary (in interactive applications).
    Some output may be provided even if flush is not set.

  Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out
  should never be zero before the call. The application can consume the
  compressed output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full
  (avail_out == 0), or after each call of deflate(). If deflate returns Z_OK
  and with zero avail_out, it must be called again after making room in the
  output buffer because there might be more output pending.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, all pending output is
  flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so
  that the decompressor can get all input data available so far. (In particular
  avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been provided
  before the call.)  Flushing may degrade compression for some compression
  algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.

    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with
  Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can
  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if
  random access is desired. Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade
  the compression.

    If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again
  with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated
  avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero
  avail_out).

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed,
  pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there
  was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be
  called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no
  more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After
  deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the
  stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd.
  
    Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression
  is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least
  0.1% larger than avail_in plus 12 bytes.  If deflate does not return
  Z_STREAM_END, then it must be called again as described above.

    deflate() sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all input read
  so (that is, total_in bytes).

    deflate() may update data_type if it can make a good guess about
  the input data type (Z_ASCII or Z_BINARY). In doubt, the data is considered
  binary. This field is only for information purposes and does not affect
  the compression algorithm in any manner.

    deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to
  Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible
  (for example avail_in or avail_out was zero).

int deflateEnd OF((z_streamp strm));
/*
     All dynamically allocated data structures for this stream are freed.
   This function discards any unprocessed input and does not flush any

     deflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the
   stream state was inconsistent, Z_DATA_ERROR if the stream was freed
   prematurely (some input or output was discarded). In the error case,
   msg may be set but then points to a static string (which must not be
   deallocated).
*/


/* 
int inflateInit OF((z_streamp strm));

     Initializes the internal stream state for decompression. The fields
   next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by

   value depends on the compression method), inflateInit determines the
   compression method from the zlib header and allocates all data structures
   accordingly; otherwise the allocation will be deferred to the first call of
   inflate.  If zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, inflateInit updates them to
   use default allocation functions.

     inflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller.  msg is set to null if there is no error
   message. inflateInit does not perform any decompression apart from reading
   the zlib header if present: this will be done by inflate().  (So next_in and
   avail_in may be modified, but next_out and avail_out are unchanged.)
*/


int inflate OF((z_streamp strm, int flush));
/*
    inflate decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may some
  introduce some output latency (reading input without producing any output)
  except when forced to flush.

  The detailed semantics are as follows. inflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in is updated and processing
    will resume at this point for the next call of inflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there
    is no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below
    about the flush parameter).

  Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.
  The application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for
  example when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each
  call of inflate(). If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it
  must be called again after making room in the output buffer because there
  might be more output pending.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, inflate flushes as much
  output as possible to the output buffer. The flushing behavior of inflate is
  not specified for values of the flush parameter other than Z_SYNC_FLUSH
  and Z_FINISH, but the current implementation actually flushes as much output
  as possible anyway.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error. However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step
  (a single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to
  Z_FINISH. In this case all pending input is processed and all pending
  output is flushed; avail_out must be large enough to hold all the
  uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved
  by the compressor for this purpose.) The next operation on this stream must
  be inflateEnd to deallocate the decompression state. The use of Z_FINISH
  is never required, but can be used to inform inflate that a faster routine
  may be used for the single inflate() call.

     If a preset dictionary is needed at this point (see inflateSetDictionary
  below), inflate sets strm-adler to the adler32 checksum of the
  dictionary chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise 
  it sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all output produced
  so (that is, total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or
  an error code as described below. At the end of the stream, inflate()
  checks that its computed adler32 checksum is equal to that saved by the
  compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END only if the checksum is correct.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed
  or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has
  been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a
  preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was
  corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect
  adler32 checksum), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent
  (for example if next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
  enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible or if there was not
  enough room in the output buffer when Z_FINISH is used. In the Z_DATA_ERROR
  case, the application may then call inflateSync to look for a good
  compression block.

                                     int  strategy));

     This is another version of deflateInit with more compression options. The
   fields next_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller.

     The method parameter is the compression method. It must be Z_DEFLATED in
   this version of the library.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for this
   version of the library. Larger values of this parameter result in better
   compression at the expense of memory usage. The default value is 15 if
   deflateInit is used instead.

     The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state. memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but
   is slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory
   for optimal speed. The default value is 8. See zconf.h for total memory
   usage as a function of windowBits and memLevel.

     The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the
   value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a
   filter (or predictor), or Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no
   string match).  Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a
   somewhat random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is
   tuned to compress them better. The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more
   Huffman coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate
   between Z_DEFAULT and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY. The strategy parameter only affects
   the compression ratio but not the correctness of the compressed output even
   if it is not set appropriately.

      deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as an invalid
   method). msg is set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit2 does
   not perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().

/*
     Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
   without producing any compressed output. This function must be called
   immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or deflateReset, before any
   call of deflate. The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same
   dictionary (see inflateSetDictionary).

     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be
   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
   with the default empty dictionary.

     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
   deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be
   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size in
   deflate or deflate2. Thus the strings most likely to be useful should be
   put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front.

     Upon return of this function, strm->adler is set to the Adler32 value
   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
   which dictionary has been used by the compressor. (The Adler32 value
   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is
   actually used by the compressor.)

     deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (such as NULL dictionary) or the stream state is
   inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for this stream
   or if the compression method is bsort). deflateSetDictionary does not

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library. The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead. If a compressed stream with a larger window size is given as
   input, inflate() will return with the error code Z_DATA_ERROR instead of
   trying to allocate a larger window.

   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as a negative
   memLevel). msg is set to null if there is no error message.  inflateInit2

  Polynomials over GF(2) are represented in binary, one bit per coefficient,
  with the lowest powers in the most significant bit.  Then adding polynomials
  is just exclusive-or, and multiplying a polynomial by x is a right shift by
  one.  If we call the above polynomial p, and represent a byte as the
  polynomial q, also with the lowest power in the most significant bit (so the
  byte 0xb1 is the polynomial x^7+x^3+x+1), then the CRC is (q*x^32) mod p,
  where a mod b means the remainder after dividing a by b.

  This calculation is done using the shift-register method of multiplying and
  taking the remainder.  The register is initialized to zero, and for each
  incoming bit, x^32 is added mod p to the register if the bit is a one (where
  x^32 mod p is p+x^32 = x^26+...+1), and the register is multiplied mod p by
  x (which is shifting right by one and adding x^32 mod p if the bit shifted
  out is a one).  We start with the highest power (least significant bit) of
  q and repeat for all eight bits of q.

  The table is simply the CRC of all possible eight bit values.  This is all
  the information needed to generate CRC's on data a byte at a time for all
  combinations of CRC register values and incoming bytes.

/*
   Notes beyond the 1.93a appnote.txt:

   1. Distance pointers never point before the beginning of the output
      stream.
   2. Distance pointers can point back across blocks, up to 32k away.
   3. There is an implied maximum of 7 bits for the bit length table and
      15 bits for the actual data.
   4. If only one code exists, then it is encoded using one bit.  (Zero
      would be more efficient, but perhaps a little confusing.)  If two
      codes exist, they are coded using one bit each (0 and 1).
   5. There is no way of sending zero distance codes--a dummy must be
      sent if there are none.  (History: a pre 2.0 version of PKZIP would
      store blocks with no distance codes, but this was discovered to be
      too harsh a criterion.)  Valid only for 1.93a.  2.04c does allow
      zero distance codes, which is sent as one code of zero bits in
      length.
   6. There are up to 286 literal/length codes.  Code 256 represents the
      end-of-block.  Note however that the static length tree defines
      288 codes just to fill out the Huffman codes.  Codes 286 and 287
      cannot be used though, since there is no length base or extra bits
      defined for them.  Similarily, there are up to 30 distance codes.
      However, static trees define 32 codes (all 5 bits) to fill out the
      Huffman codes, but the last two had better not show up in the data.
   7. Unzip can check dynamic Huffman blocks for complete code sets.
      The exception is that a single code would not be complete (see #4).
   8. The five bits following the block type is really the number of
      literal codes sent minus 257.
   9. Length codes 8,16,16 are interpreted as 13 length codes of 8 bits
      (1+6+6).  Therefore, to output three times the length, you output
      three codes (1+1+1), whereas to output four times the same length,
      you only need two codes (1+3).  Hmm.
  10. In the tree reconstruction algorithm, Code = Code + Increment
      only if BitLength(i) is not zero.  (Pretty obvious.)
  11. Correction: 4 Bits: # of Bit Length codes - 4     (4 - 19)
  12. Note: length code 284 can represent 227-258, but length code 285
      really is 258.  The last length deserves its own, short code
      since it gets used a lot in very redundant files.  The length
      258 is special since 258 - 3 (the min match length) is 255.
  13. The literal/length and distance code bit lengths are read as a
      single stream of lengths.  It is possible (and advantageous) for
      a repeat code (16, 17, or 18) to go across the boundary between
      the two sets of lengths.

/*
   Huffman code decoding is performed using a multi-level table lookup.
   The fastest way to decode is to simply build a lookup table whose
   size is determined by the longest code.  However, the time it takes
   to build this table can also be a factor if the data being decoded
   is not very long.  The most common codes are necessarily the
   shortest codes, so those codes dominate the decoding time, and hence
   the speed.  The idea is you can have a shorter table that decodes the
   shorter, more probable codes, and then point to subsidiary tables for
   the longer codes.  The time it costs to decode the longer codes is
   then traded against the time it takes to make longer tables.

   This results of this trade are in the variables lbits and dbits
   below.  lbits is the number of bits the first level table for literal/
   length codes can decode in one step, and dbits is the same thing for
   the distance codes.  Subsequent tables are also less than or equal to
   those sizes.  These values may be adjusted either when all of the
   codes are shorter than that, in which case the longest code length in
   bits is used, or when the shortest code is *longer* than the requested
   table size, in which case the length of the shortest code in bits is
   used.

   There are two different values for the two tables, since they code a
   different number of possibilities each.  The literal/length table
   codes 286 possible values, or in a flat code, a little over eight
   bits.  The distance table codes 30 possible values, or a little less
   than five bits, flat.  The optimum values for speed end up being
   about one bit more than those, so lbits is 8+1 and dbits is 5+1.
   The optimum values may differ though from machine to machine, and
   possibly even between compilers.  Your mileage may vary.
