- New: -nostyles switch on light phase disabling lightstyles
- Using libmhash cryptographic hashing library instead of md5lib


2.5.15 (2004-07-08)

- New: q3map_rgbGen, q3map_rgbMod or q3map_colorGen, q3map_colorMod
- New: q3map_alphaGen const (like q3map_alphaMod set)
- New: q3map_noVertexLight to suppress overwriting of vertex rgb
- q3map_backShader now works again, can be used instead of
  q3map_cloneShader + q3map_invert on the target shader

  overflows and ugly self-shadowing errors on surface boundaries
- Any use of lightstyles automatically sets -nocollapse to reduce
  total shader counts

2.5.14 (2004-04-09)

- New: -dirty mode courtesy of RaP7oR (dirtmapping/ambient occlusion)
- New: q3map_skyLight code using more uniform angular distribution about
  the sky hemisphere
- New: q3map_alphaMod set N.N
- New: q3map_alphaMod scale N.N
- New: q3map_alphaMod volume - applies all other q3map_alphaMod directives
  to each vertex inside a brush textured with this shader, allowing large
  faded scrolling fire shaders, waterfalls, marquees, explicit dotProduct
  terrain blending control, etc.
- Fixed a bug in alphaMod code where the type of the first alphaMod was
  being used for all subsequent alphaMods
- Lowered vertex-lit surface limits to 999 verts, 1000 was breaking Quake 3
- Tightened up solid lightmap tolerances
- Fixed bug in solid lightmap code where lightmap SD coords were being
  incorrectly set


2.5.13 (2004-03-03)

- New: -convert -format <game> to convert between different BSP formats.
  Example, to convert a Jedi Academy map to Enemy Territory:
  -game ja -convert -format et
- New: -game etut support for Urban Terror on Enemy Territory
- New: -analyze mode for reverse engineering a BSP format
- New: -compensate N.N (default 1.0) for descaling lightmap/vertex/grid
  data to compensate for ingame overbrighting. 4.0 is a good value for
  Quake 3 if used in combination with -gamma 2.2
- New: compensate/gamma per-game setting
- New: -light -cpma argument for "classic" (sic) vertex lighting
- Replaced malloc() with stack allocation in IlluminateRawLightmap for
  most small/medium lightmap calculations
- Misc cleanups in q3map2.h
- Support for non-128x128 lightmaps
- The -meta process will now generate surfaces with more than 64
  verts that have non-lightmapped shaders
- Extended lightmap size tolerance to 2x for merging meta triangles in
  maps with aggressive lightmapscale. Sorry kids!
- Moved surface finish pass (celshading, cloning) to final surface pass.
  This should fix a bug involving fog/tesselation/celshading/cloning
- Solid-color lightmaps (within 1/255 in RGB) are detected and replaced
  with a single pixel lightmap, saving space


2.5.12 (2004-01-18)

- New: -dark option for dark lightmap/brush seams in -light (Unreal 1-ish)
- New: spawnflags 4 on misc_model entities makes them forcemeta/lightmapped
  unless explicitly set as vertex lit in their shader(s). This can be
  combined with spawnflags 2 (solid) as spawnflags 6
- New: -gamma N.N switch sets lightmap/vertex gamma value for more
  realistic lighting, instead of using high ambient/minlight. Default
  is 1.0 (linear ramp), good values are between 1.5 and 2.2
- Changed q3map_lightmapGamma N.N to q3map_lightmapBrightness N.N, to
  better match its intended function
- Ported to VS.NET 2003 and GtkRadiant 1.5 (spog_branch)
- Fixed bug in _skybox maps where sunlight was leaking through brushes.
  Thanks pjw!
- Fixed bug in ASE loader where models without submodels/submaterials
  would not load properly.
- Fixed bug where q3map_tcGen was not being applied to models
- Optimized MergeMetaTriangles a bit
- Added KOR's fix to raytracer
- -bouncegrid no longer affects the lightgrid dir
- Added feature to PicoModel where spaces in material names in 3DS, ASE
  and LWO models will mark the end of the shader name, so you can have
  "textures/foo/bar 1" and "textures/foo/bar 2" in Lightwave, and both
  surfaces will map to "textures/foo/bar"


2.5.11 (2003-12-01)

- New: added support for _skybox entities to generate "portal sky"
  surfaces in games w/o native support (Quake 3). _skybox entities have
  3 keys: _scale (default 64), and angle/angles (for rotation of the
  skybox relative to the map)
- New: added -skyfix switch to BSP phase as a workaround hack for
  the black GL_CLAMP border on skybox edges on ATI (and newer nvidia)
  video cards. Note: unnecessary in ET or JA
- New: Added _anglescale to light entities for scaling angle attenuation.
  Use a small value (< 1.0) to lessen the angle attenuation, and a high
  value (> 1.0) for sharper, more faceted lighting
- New: Added _lightmapscale support to misc_model entities
- Custom shaders (external lightmaps, styles) will not be generated
  if the find/replace text cannot be found
- Tightened up light culling epsilon from 1.0 to 0.125 to stop certain
  surface lights from being incorrectly culled (thanks RasputiN!)
- Fixed bug where small 3 and 4 sided brush faces were getting fanned,
  adding triangle/vertex counts
- Moved to Visual Studio .NET, with aggressive optimizations enabled
- Cleaned up missing image warnings
- Parsing images out of shader stages if not found explicit/implicitly
- Loads Enemy Territory implicitMap images if editor/light image not found


2.5.10 (2003-10-22)

- New: Lightwave model support (beta) courtesy of RR2DO2
- New: Heretic 2 FM model support courtesy of Nurail
- Re-enabled vertex cache friendly triangle reordering with fix
- Disabled triangle reordering on certain surfaces, including autosprite
  shaders due to visual errors
- Fixed bug in radiosity where sorting of lights by style took forever.
  Thanks ReBoOT!
- Fixed bug in sun lighting code where maps too far off the origin would
  not be properly it by sun or sky light. Thanks MindLink!
- Entity causing a leak will be printed and selected in Radiant if BSP
  monitoring is enabled. Requested by heeen
- Fixed odd bug causing 10x slowdown in lighting in some maps. Should
  be back to 2.5.7 performance. Also fixed a couple old bugs related to
  autosprite shader (point) lights and backsplash lights not being styled
  or setup correctly


2.5.9 (2003-10-12)

- Disabled triangle reordering for now (crashing on some maps)


2.5.8 (2003-10-02)

- New: Added two new sun parameters: angular deviation (width of the sun in
  degrees) and sampling count (jitters). This allows for decent approximation
  of penumbra "half-shadow" effects from sunlight with 16+ samples. These
  parameters are accessible for entity lights (including spots and suns) via
  these entity keys: _deviance and _samples. To use in shaders, use the new
  q3map_sunExt <r> <g> <b> <brightness> <angle> <elevation> <deviance> <samples>
- New: q3map_lightmapFilterRadius <self> <other> for light-emitting shaders.
  Put *after* any q3map_sun directives or else your sun will be filtered. This
  is good for eliminating the "stadium lighting" effect from q3map_skyLight.
  Also usable as an entity key: _filterradius or _filter
- New: Quake 2 MD2 model support in PicoModel for misc_model entities
  (thanks to Nurail!)
- Re-enabled vertex-cache-aware triangle reordering. Will probably have a
  negligible effect on rendering performance, but can't hurt
- Added short-circuit to raytracer: any empty nodes (including children) are
  ignored on sun traces
- Added BSP file size printout
- Filtering of any kind now disables adaptive supersampling on a per-light,
  per-ightmap basis
- Fixed another _minlight <-> styled light interaction bug (thanks pjw!)


2.5.7 (2003-08-31)

- New: Jedi Academy support via -game ja
- New: DDS (DXT1/3/5) texture support for future games
- Re-enabled q3map_surfaceModel support, and the 'oriented' flag works as well
- Re-enabled (fixed, really) large external lightmap support
- Fixed a bug in the model code that would cause a crash if an uninvertable
  matrix was created
- Fixed a bug in Mathlib m4x4_t code where the tolerance for a singular matrix
  was too low and crapping out on small (scaled down) matrices
- Fixed bug in divide-by-zero on lightmap efficiency calculation
- Added -force switch, allows unsupported BSP formats to (try) to be loaded


2.5.6 (2003-08-15)

- New: can convert BSP files to MAP files via -convert -format map. Note: not
  perfect by any means, as certain pieces of data are irretrievably lost, such
  as func_group entities (including terrain specifics), brush face texturing
  info, and light/misc_model entities with Q3Map2-generated BSPs


2.5.5

- New: -scale N.N mode to scale the BSP
- New: -light -lomem switch to supress trace BSP optimization. This
  feature trades lighting performance for decreased memory usage
- New: Added negative light support (note: will not darken below _minlight value)
  might screw up radiosity, haven't tested much. Should work with entity
  lights, shader lights, sun/sky lights and radiosity. Lightfilter shadows
  tint negative lights too, so the end effect is subtraction of the color
- New: Lightstyle support for non-Raven (JK2/SOF2) games, including Quake 3,
  RTCW, ET, EF. Only works with lightmapped surfaces, use with care
- Fixed long standing terrain texturing bug, should produce exact desired
  results all of the time now. May require fixing alphamaps that were
  kludged together to accomodate this bug on existing maps
- Fixed bug (huh, wtf) causing misc_model surfaces to not be fogged
- Fixed bug where fog brushes wouldn't fog surfaces if a global map fog
  shader was present
- Fixed bug where -patchmeta surfaces were being ignored for raytracing
- Fixed long-standing bug where twosided surfaces were not correctly
  bouncing light. You can now have a foggy glass window that re-emits
  bright light with q3map_bounce 3.0 or so
- Fixed really stupid bug in radiosity with bouncing styled lights
- Stripping .map and appending .bsp in -info mode
- Fixed bug where tesselated brush face surfaces were not being fogged
- Twosided surfaces (using cull disable/twosided/none) are now lit twosided
- Added tighter tolerance for alphashadow/lightfilter shadowing to raytracer
  which fixed problem with double shadows from tracing near triangle seams
- Brush entities should now be properly fogged. Really.
- Styled lightmaps are no longer affected by _minlight (doh)


2.5.4 (2003-04-01)

- New: q3map_tessSize support for JK2/SOF2
- New: -lightmapsize N argument
- Fixed bug where switched styled lights weren't working correctly in SOF2/JK2
- Fixed bug where external lightmaps with generated shaders were referencing
  the wrong lightmap
- Fixed bug causing lightgrid brushes to be ignored
- Added variable sphere around trace sample points to inhibit occluder geometry


2.5.3 (2003-03-06)

- New: SOF2/JK2 light styles now supported
- New: q3map_lightStyle N to set shader lightstyles
- New: Tenebrae 2 support via -game tenebrae
- New: -light -deluxe and -debugdeluxe for Tenebrae "deluxemap" static
  lighting algorithm
- Light envelopes now properly clipped to the PVS
- q3map_vertexScale re-enabled (scales vertex lighting per-shader)
- Minor bug in brush bevel code corrected
- Brushes from func_group entities are correctly sorted on insertion
- Fixed a couple misc warnings to print "percent" instead of "%"
- Added -custinfoparms support to -light mode to suppress warnings
- _minlight, _minvertexlight and _mingridlight order independent, and now
  allow for values of 0


2.5.2 (2003-02-17)

- Fixed crash bugs with global map fog
- Model loading really only warns once now


2.5.1 (2003-02-17) (Splash Damage internal release)

- Added more Hella-Fast juice to light code. Overall should be 35% faster
- Refactored surface portion of raytracer code for less memory usage
- Changed UVW epsilon in raytracer to catch more edge cases
- Removed bounds check on occluded luxel finding, was causing more problems
  than it was solving
- Adaptive antialiasing code now ignores unmapped luxels for better shadow
  edges and higher performance
- Brushes in the BSP are now sorted opaque first
- Fixed Really Stupid bug causing MapRawLightmap to take about 4x as long
- Added optimization to make MapRawLightmap 2x as fast
- New non-sucky quadrilateral subdivision of patches for MapRawLightmap
- Patches with < 90 degrees of curvature are now box-lightmapped
- Patch vertex normals now correctly stored, fixing bug in 2.5.0
- Prints warning if map with < 10% detail brushes is detected


2.5.0 (2003-02-14) (Splash Damage internal release)

RAYTRACING AND SHADOW CALCULATION
- New raytracing code. Rewrote the raytracer to maximize efficiency on modern
  "caulk-hull" maps. Uses triangle intercept code written by SPoG, based on code
  by Tomas Moller and Ben Trumbore (Journal of Graphics Tools, 2(1):21-28, 1997)
  and a biased octree leaf subdivision scheme by Y.T.
- Shadows (casting and receiving) are now controllable per-entity
  New entity keys: "_castShadows" or "_cs" and "_receiveShadows" or "_rc"
  Values: 0 = no shadows, 1 = worldspawn shadows, > 1 explicit shadow group,
  negative values imply no worldspawn shadow interation.
  *Entities, including model2 and RTCW misc_gamemodels can now cast shadows*

RADIOSITY
- Bumped up default and smallest radiosity patch size. Performance should be
  approximately 4x with a small quality tradeoff
- Radiosity patches now trace to centroid of triangle, and not bounds center
- Radiosity and surface lights are now nudged around a bit if in solid
- Radiosity light generation code is now thread-safe
- Radiosity -dump files now .map instead of .pfb
- Poorly worded "q3map_bounce" renamed to "q3map_bounceScale" (old still works)
- New -bounceonly switch to store only bounced light in the BSP (for Tenebrae)

MISC LIGHTING
- Optimized case where light and sample are coplanar
- Forcing nudged luxels to stay within lightmap surfaces' bounds

CURVED SURFACES
- New -subdivisions N argument, works with -patchmeta and -light for setting
  patch level-of-detail. Default value is 8, use 4 to simulate default Q3
- All patch tesselation code changed to create x-patterned tesselation for
  better lighting
- Storing patch LOD info in the .srf file for better patch light/shadows

FOG
- Reworked fog code to fix bad interation with fog and clipped models

MODELS
- Entities with attached MD3/ASE misc_models now have their bounds correctly set
- Attached misc_models now support q3map_clipModel for solidity
- Missing models will only warn once, rather than spew errors

MISC
- Metasurface merging no longer folds nonplanar triangles into planar surfaces
  and vice-versa *
- Fixed Really Stupid Bug where entity numbering was not loaded by lighting code
  resulting in lightmaps merging across entity boundaries *

* Might result in slightly larger BSP. For maximum efficiency, ungroup
  func_group entities before doing a final compile

TODO
+ Document new shadow stuff
+ Merge adjacent light-casting triangles into convex windings


2.3.38 (2003-02-07)

- New lighting code, return of Smoove-B. Intelligently antialises shadow edges
  when you use the new -samples N switch. Get -extra quality in 1/3 the time
- New lightmap filtering code. Now using a proper 0.25/0.5/1.0 filter kernel.
  Also operates on individual lightsources, so per-lightsource filter/kernel
  settings are now possible
- New -patchmeta fixes, now does stitching and adaptive subdivision.
  Thanks Sock!
- Nonsolid patches will no longer be in the BSP when run with -patchmeta
- Misc fog fixes, including q3map_noFog support in maps with global _fog
  support (SOF2/JK2)
- Now stripping misc_model entities from the BSP
- Fixed disappearing face bug that's been present since 2.3.36.
  Thanks Shadowspawn!


2.3.37 (2003-01-24)

- Building from GtkRadiant CVS trunk
- Added new brush bevel code by MrElusive to fix lingering aas problems (sweet!)
- Added -snap N arg to BSP phase for axial bevel plane snapping to reduce
  clipped model plane count (note: will muck with above, use with care)
- Patches in terrain entities should now have proper vertex alpha set
- Fixed bug in fur code where fur was being limited to 2 layers (thanks pazur)
- Reduced vertexlight search area to a reasonable size to keep vertex lighting
  times down


2.3.36 (2003-01-15)

- Plane hashing re-enabled (I suck)
- Plane hashing optimized (faster parsing of larger maps)
- Plane finding accuracy code enabled
- New ASE clipping code
  + With above should be 10-50% faster
  + Should generate 33% fewer planes
  + Generates mostly-axial 5-sided polyhedra instead of pyramids,
    for tighter 2-sided clipping
- New -light args:
  + -scale N -- scales all lightsources (area, radiosity, point, sky)
  + -sky[scale] N -- scales sky lights (q3map_skylight, q3map_sunlight)
- Changed fur code to scale fur offset based on original vertex alpha


2.3.35 (2003-01-14)

- PicoModel now inverts ASE T coordinate
- BSP to ASE converter now inverts T coordinate
- Disabling 2.3.34 triangle optimization code until I find out why it crashes
- Fixed Conscript-q3map2 to use stack_size ld flags directly on Darwin/OS X
- Added Conscript-q3map2 to q3map2.dsp for easier Win32 edit, *nix target


2.3.34 (2003-01-08)

- Building from merged GtkRadiant 1.2 -> 1.3 merged codebase
- IMPORTANT NEW CHANGE: Light entities are now STRIPPED from the BSP file.
  They are re-read in by -light from the MAP file. This has two consequences:
  + It is no longer necessary to re-BSP & re-vis a map in order to change
    lighting. You can just change lights in the map file and run -light.
  + Slightly smaller BSP file, due to fewer entities
  + Faster loading time, as the game code doesn't have to deal with them
- Added new -ne (normal epsilon) and -de (distance epsilon) for tuning precision
  of plane snapping to correct potential AAS/BSP issues
- Using latest PicoModel, with support for RTCW MDC models
- Surfaces per raw lightmap are now sorted by shader name, which should give
  slightly better lightmap efficiency and lower in-game shader counts
- Adjusted model code to use correct m4x4_t code & angles key
- Minor bugfix in patch color gradient calculation code
- Silenced erroneous areaportal warning spew
- q3map_tcGen now works on model surfaces
- Using default radiosity subdivide of 256 again (should make radiosity faster)
- Enabled byte-swapping code so Q3Map2 can be compiled/run on little-endian
  architectures (Mac OS X)


2.3.33 (2002-12-08)

- Added new -bouncescale argument for radiosity scaling
- Added -pointscale and -areascale for consistent naming
- Radiosity patch subdivision code enhanced
- Hint portals split the BSP first (higher priority)
- Antiportal and areaportal faces split the BSP last, to minimize errors
- Areaportals work internally like hint and antiportals, so they no longer need
  to be full brushes (the other sides can be skip)
- External lightmaps are now named "lm_NNNN.tga" in the maps/mapname dir
- Cleaned up some of -light argument processing
- Planar surfaces w/o lightmaps will no longer be tagged as MST_TRIANGLE_SOUP
  (this fixes problems with Particle Studio particles dropping out of view)


2.3.32 (2002-11-30)

- GtkRadiant (1.2.11) integration
- Added epsilon to texture plane choose code to eliminate numerical
  inconsistencies on brush faces slanted at 45 degree angles (bug 637)
- Fixed bug in lightmap export after lighting when map contains 0 BSP lightmaps
- Adjusted some light tracing constants to fix certain brush/patch seam shadows
- Tinkered with skylight code again
- Fixed bug where lightgrid would be black if level was compiled with -nogrid
- Fixed -approx code to work in floating-point space, using _minlight
- Fixed bug where vertex light code was using invalid pvs data to create
  light list for surface, leading to incorrect vertex lighting
- Fixed related bug in anti-light-leak code that was causing brush faces to go
  black (bug 694)
- New: _minlight sets _minvertexlight and (new) _mingridlight automatically
- New: _mingridlight key to set minimum grid lighting


2.3.31 (2002-11-21)

- Stitching the edges of lightmaps on patches that wrap around (cyls and cones)
  so the seam is no longer visible
- The -patchmeta switch works better now, the patches are still stored in the
  BSP for collision, but are pre-tesselated into nonplanar meta surfaces for
  more efficient rendering
- Better, more uniform lightmap sample position finding on patch meshes
- Moved q3map_tcMod and q3map_alphaMod processing to the final phase
- New: q3map_skylight AMOUNT ITERATIONS to replace surfacelight on sky surfaces
  for much faster and more uniform sky illumination


2.3.30 (Splash Damage internal release)

- Fixed bug in PicoModel ASE material parsing code
- Fixed a few seam/lightmap precision/projection errors
- Increased MAX_SHADER FILES to 1024 and fixed overrun error when more than that
  number of shaders was listed in shaderlist.txt
- Increased a few compiler maximums for larger maps
- New: -np N switch on BSP phase, works like -shadeangle, in that it forces all
  planar shaders to be nonplanar with the shading angle specified
- New: -nohint switch on BSP phase, omits hint brushes from compile for testing
- New: -debugaxis switch on light mode. Colors lightmaps based on their lightmap
  axis (which direction the lightmap was projected on)
- New: -debugorigin switch on light mode. Colors lightmaps based on the luxel
  origin relative to the raw lightmap's bounding box
- New: -debugcluster switch on light mode. Colors lightmaps based on the pvs
  cluster the luxel falls into
- New: -convert switch to convert BSP to ASE file (experimental)
- New: q3map_lightmapmergable directive to allow terrain to be mapped onto a
  single lightmap page for seamless terrain shadows


2.3.29 (2002-11-03)

- Merged with latest CVS, fixed minor issues with matrix order
- Fixed minor Sys_FPrintf/Sys_Printf substitution typo in Q3Map2
- Expanded debug colors to 12 for debugging surface meshes
- PicoModel: fixed ASE loader to support > 1 texture coordinate per-vertex,
  so more models supported correctly, also loading vertex normals
- PicoModel: md3 shader names are now cleaned. Suffixes (such as .tga or .jpg)
  are stripped, and \ path separators are changed to /
- New: Add :q3map to the end of any shader name, and it will be interpreted as
  the named shader minus :q3map. Example:
  textures/shaderlab/concrete:q3map -> textures/shaderlab/concrete
  One potential use is the -approx feature to collapse lightmapped  surfaces
  into vertexlit surfaces, saving lightmap space/memory
- New: q3map_clipModel -- does what you think it does, sort of. This code ix
  really experimental, and should *only* be used on large models such as terrain
  (not small decorative models). This code will be evolving. Note: the shader's
  surfaceparms are inherited by the magic clip brush, so if you have nonsolid
  in your model's shader that uses q3map_clipModel, then the brush will also
  be nonsolid


2.3.28 (2002-11-01)

- Bug 654 (http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=654):
  Fixed problem where brush faces, drawsurfaces, and surfaceparms weren't living
  together in perfect harmony (terrain surfaceparms now inherited by brushes)
- Nodraw fog works now, albeit when you're underneath, surfaces above don't get
  fogged properly. Could be good for foggy water where you want the above-water
  portions to only be occluded by the water surface
- Bug 656 (http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=656):
  Number of lightgrid points displayed (byte size is currently out of proportion
  due to internal storage format) when Q3Map is called with the -info switch
- Fixed wack surface merging bug where code would attempt to merge triangles not
  adjacent to the current set, causing bad lightmap projections on nonplanar
  surfaces
- Fixed tiny 1-character bug in 2d lightmap texture allocator where adjacent
  luxels were being checked for occlusion rather than the actual source luxel


2.3.27 (2002-10-31) Happy Halloween!

- Fixed minor bug in scriplib bugfix where the last character in a file wasn't
  being read.
- Fixed bug where 0-area or bogus triangles were causing crash in MapRawLightmap
  if they used a shader with a normalmap (thanks ShadowSpawn)
- Fixed bug where lightmaps were getting hosed levelwide on a prerelease version
  of 2.3.27
- Fixed bug where lightmaps were getting knackered on models and certain patches
- Merged latest PicoModel version from seaw0lf, adding support for ASE and WF OBJ
  models (preliminary)
- Increased MAX_MAP_PLANES to 0x40000 (~256k)

Known issues:
- Lightmap projection and surface merging on large ASE models sometimes flakes
- Surface to brush surfaceparm propogation doesn't work properly with large
  metasurfaces: http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=654


2.3.26 (2002-10-27)

- Now using GtkRadiant's libpng and zlib config (linked as DLLs)
- Fixed bug in script parser where repeat calls to GetToken() were causing
  memory corruption
- Fixed SOF2 -rename bug
- When using -game sof2 or -game jk2, the -flares argument is implied
- Added -noflares argument to disable the above behavior
- Added support for flares on entities. Use one of the following keys:
  "_flare" "1" -- use default flare (different for each game)
  "_flareshader" "path/to/flareshader" -- use a specific flare shader
  Note: This only matters in SOF2/JK2 now. Make a light targetted (a spotlight)
  to get it to aim the correct direction, otherwise it defaults to pointing 
  downward. You cannot have omnidirectional flares
- Lightgrid size is automatically increased to accomodate large maps. The
  MAX_MAP_LIGHTGRID error will never happen again


2.3.25 (2002-10-22)

- Go Giants!
- Fixed bug where Q3Map would crash on writing the BSP after the light stage.
  Thanks to Rap7or (#q3map) and loon8 (Q3W forums) [bug 641]
- Fixed bug where surface lights were not affecting the light grid properly.
  Thanks to Shadowspawn and djbob [bug 642]
- NEW: Added -faster support to lightgrid calculations while fixing previous bug
- NEW: Changed it so the BSP file is written to a temp file first, then renamed.
  This should prevent BSP file corruption on crashes during writes


2.3.24 (2002-10-20)

- Fixed numerous outstanding bugs and issues.
- Normal interpolation is now improved. It's slightly slower, but more 'correct'
  in cases where you have 10 triangles in one plane and 1 triangle in another
  meeting up and the 10 triangles were over-affecting the average. Only new
  identical normals are averaged now. This change affects phong shading, meta
  surfaces, and PicoModel
- PicoModel up to version 0.7.6, BSD license, better 3DS model support
- PicoModel library now fixes broken normals on MD3 and 3DS models
- Bumpmapping code is improved. The correct tangent vectors per-triangle are
  now calculated so the bumpmaps are consistent with regards to light direction
- Metasurface merging code optimized. Should be about 100x as fast on complex
  maps or maps using models with high triangle counts
- Vertexlight code tweaked a bit
- Triangle/winding orders now more consistent. Tesselated surfaces will have
  a uniform triangle ordering (thanks RR2DO2)
- NEW: "vertexDeform move" now parsed and surfaces are merged into the
  appropriate  BSP leaves they may enter into (thanks to Bart Vrijkorte)
- NEW: shader command: q3map_alphaMod. Currently takes a single form:
  q3map_alphaMod dotproduct ( NX NY NZ )
  where NX NY NZ are a unit normal (length of 1.0) specifying direction.
  An example use would be snow in a shader's 2nd pass, using alphaFunc or
  blendFunc:
  q3map_alphaMod dotproduct ( 0 0 1 ) // surfaces facing upwards have snow

2.3.23 (2002-10-18)

- In my haste to release the previous version, I neglected to give credit where
  it was due. Seaw0lf had as much (probably more) to do with the new model
  loading library (PicoModel). Because of his efforts, you can load 3DS models
  and use them in misc_model entities.
- PicoModel model library up to version 0.7. Improved 3DS support, more stable.
- Surface models still not reenabled. Soon. :)
- You can now remap a misc_model's shaders like this:
  Key "_remapNN" "the/model/shader;the/real/shader"
  This works just like TA terrain vertexRemapShader key. You can also supply a
  * glob for the source shader if you want all your model's shaders to use the
  specified shader:
  "_remap" "*;models/mapobjects/tree/bark"


2.3.22 (2002-10-16)

- Moving to sensible Linux-style versioning.
- The misc_model code has been completely rewritten, breaking surface models.
  Surface models will reappear in the next release, once the new model API has
  stablized.
- New: MD3 and 3D Studio 3DS models now natively supported.
- The misc_model "angles" key now supported. Values: "pitch yaw roll" in keeping
  with standard Quake 3 angles order.
- Models scaled with "modelscale_vec" now have proper normal scaling/rotation
  (thanks SPOG).
- Models can now be lightmapped.
- Models can now have > 1000 vertexes per surface.
- For best results for above, add the following to models' shaders:
  q3map_splotchfix
  q3map_nonplanar
- 3DS models' MATERIAL NAMES ARE THE FINAL Q3 SHADER NAMES. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
- Models are generally 13373R. :)


2.3.0-a21 (2002-10-02)

- Fixed a stack of really stupid bugs in the lightgrid code. Should be faster
  and more predictable now.
- SOF2/JK2 lightgrid now compiled. This is the first version of Q3Map2 that can
  compile full, release-worthy SOF2 and JK2 maps.
- SOF2/JK2 damageshader and damagable brush faces should work correctly now.


2.3.0-a20 (2002-09-26)

- SOF2/JK2 worldspawn "fog" (and "_fog") shader key support for levelwide fog
- SOF2/JK2 light "scale" key to scale light brightness
- SOF2/JK2 -rename function for _bsp and _rmg_bsp shader renaming


2.3.0-a19 (2002-09-24)

- Shaders can now be subclassed (Q3Map relavant portions only, such as
  surfaceparms, lighting, texture projection, etc). To subclass an existing
  shader, add "q3map_baseshader X" where X is the name of the base shader.
- Preliminary auto-model distribution over surfaces. You can now have things
  like grass and tree models automatically distributed across your terrain
  or other surfaces. To wit:

  q3map_surfacemodel models/mapobjects/tree2/tree2.md3 64 0.001 0.5 4.0 0 360 1

  q3map_surfacemodel <path to md3> <density in units> <odds of appearing>
      <min scale> <max scale> <min angle> <max angle> <oriented>
  
  The last flag is 1 or 0, and sets whether the model gets fitted to the
  orientation of the surface. Not functional yet. See screenshots page for
  shots of this in action.


2.3.0-a18 (2002-09-21)

- misc_models can now be attached to any brush model entity. Just target the
  brush entity with the misc_model (select model, then entity, hit Ctrl+K)
- q3map_tcMod translate (or shift or offset) <s offset> <t offset>
- q3map_tcMod rotate <degrees> (rotates around origin, not center)
- q3map_tcMod scale <s scale> <t scale>
- Metasurface merging now much, much better. Merges into roughly rectangular or
  square areas wherever possible
- q3map_terrain no longer sets Z-axis lightmap projection. It must be set in
  the terrain layer shaders if you want previous behavior
- Worlspawn _blocksize key now supports 3 elements for setting X Y and Z splits
  independently of each other (use a value of 0 for no splits on that axis)
- Misc bugfixes


2.3.0-a1 through 2.3.0-a17 (2002-07 through 2002-09-20)

- Elite Force support (via -game ef)
- SOF2 and JK2 support (via -game sof2 or -game jk2)
- All new image handling with PNG support
- q3map_lightimage specifies image for radiosity and lighting
- External lightmaps, set using q3map_lightmapsize <width> <height>. Up to
  1024 x 1024 supported.
- q3map_lightmapGamma <value> sets the brightness scale of a lightmap
- q3map_lightmapsampleoffset <distance> to fix glitches in lightmapped terrain
- Tons more features and bugfixes. See the forum threads for details/screenshots
- Two new surfaceparms, "antiportal" and "skip," and associated shaders, for
  allowing the mapper to more cleanly set up visibility data
- Lightmaps will always have square texels now (no more stretching)
- Vertex light improvements
- Light grid improvements
- q3map_lightrgb support for RTCW
