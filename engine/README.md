The intent of this project is to provide a baseline Quake 3 which may be used
for further development and baseq3 fun.
Some of the major features currently implemented are:

  * SDL backend
  * OpenAL sound API support (multiple speaker support and better sound
    quality)
  * Full x86_64 support on Linux
  * VoIP support, both in-game and external support through Mumble.
  * MinGW compilation support on Windows and cross compilation support on Linux
  * AVI video capture of demos
  * Much improved console autocompletion
  * Persistent console history
  * Colorized terminal output
  * Optional Ogg Vorbis support
  * Much improved QVM tools
  * Support for various esoteric operating systems
  * cl_guid support
  * HTTP/FTP download redirection (using cURL)
  * Multiuser support on Windows systems (user specific game data
    is stored in "%APPDATA%\Quake3")
  * PNG support
  * Many, many bug fixes

The map editor and associated compiling tools are not included. We suggest you
use a modern copy from http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/.

The original id software readme that accompanied the Q3 source release has been
renamed to id-readme.txt so as to prevent confusion. Please refer to the
website for updated status.

More documentation including a Player's Guide and Sysadmin Guide is on:

# Compilation and installation

For *nix
  1. Change to the directory containing this readme.
  2. Run 'make'.

For Windows,
  1. Please refer to the excellent instructions here:
     http://wiki.ioquake3.org/Building_ioquake3

For Mac OS X, building a Universal Binary
  1. Install MacOSX SDK packages from XCode.  For maximum compatibility,
     install MacOSX10.4u.sdk and MacOSX10.3.9.sdk, and MacOSX10.2.8.sdk.
  2. Change to the directory containing this README file.
  3. Run './make-macosx-ub.sh'
  4. Copy the resulting ioquake3.app in /build/release-darwin-ub to your
     /Applications/ioquake3 folder.

Installation, for *nix
  1. Set the COPYDIR variable in the shell to be where you installed Quake 3
     to. By default it will be /usr/local/games/quake3 if you haven't set it.
     This is the path as used by the original Linux Q3 installer and subsequent
     point releases.
  2. Run 'make copyfiles'.

It is also possible to cross compile for Windows under *nix using MinGW. Your
distribution may have mingw32 packages available. On debian/Ubuntu, you need to
install 'mingw-w64'. Thereafter cross compiling is simply a case running
'PLATFORM=mingw32 ARCH=x86 make' in place of 'make'. ARCH may also be set to
x86_64.

The following variables may be set, either on the command line or in
Makefile.local:

# README for Developers

## pk3dir

ioquake3 has a useful new feature for mappers. Paths in a game directory with
the extension ".pk3dir" are treated like pk3 files. This means you can keep
all files specific to your map in one directory tree and easily zip this
folder for distribution.

## 64bit mods

If you wish to compile external mods as shared libraries on a 64bit platform,
and the mod source is derived from the id Q3 SDK, you will need to modify the
interface code a little. Open the files ending in _syscalls.c and change
every instance of int to intptr_t in the declaration of the syscall function
pointer and the dllEntry function. Also find the vmMain function for each
module (usually in cg_main.c g_main.c etc.) and similarly replace the return
value in the prototype with intptr_t (arg0, arg1, ...stay int).

Add the following code snippet to q_shared.h:

    #ifdef Q3_VM
    typedef int intptr_t;
    #else
    #include <stdint.h>
    #endif

Note if you simply wish to run mods on a 64bit platform you do not need to
recompile anything since by default Q3 uses a virtual machine system.

## Creating mods compatible with Q3 1.32b

If you're using this package to create mods for the last official release of
Q3, it is necessary to pass the commandline option '-vq3' to your invocation
of q3asm. This is because by default q3asm outputs an updated qvm format that
is necessary to fix a bug involving the optimizing pass of the x86 vm JIT
compiler.

## Creating standalone games

Have you finished the daunting task of removing all dependencies on the Q3
game data? You probably now want to give your users the opportunity to play
the game without owning a copy of Q3, which consequently means removing cd-key
and authentication server checks. In addition to being a straightforward Q3
client, ioquake3 also purports to be a reliable and stable code base on which
to base your game project.

However, before you start compiling your own version of ioquake3, you have to
ask yourself: Have we changed or will we need to change anything of importance
in the engine?

If your answer to this question is "no", it probably makes no sense to build
your own binaries. Instead, you can just use the pre-built binaries on the
website. Just make sure the game is called with:

    +set com_basegame <yournewbase>

in any links/scripts you install for your users to start the game. The
binary must not detect any original quake3 game pak files. If this
condition is met, the game will set com_standalone to 1 and is then running
in stand alone mode.

If you want the engine to use a different directory in your homepath than
e.g. "Quake3" on Windows or ".q3a" on Linux, then set a new name at startup
by adding

    +set com_homepath <homedirname>

to the command line. You can also control which game name to use when talking
to the master server:

    +set com_gamename <gamename>

So clients requesting a server list will only receive servers that have a
matching game name.

Example line:

    +set com_basegame basefoo +set com_homepath .foo
    +set com_gamename foo

If you really changed parts that would make vanilla ioquake3 incompatible with
your mod, we have included another way to conveniently build a stand-alone
binary. Just run make with the option BUILD_STANDALONE=1. Don't forget to edit
the PRODUCT_NAME and subsequent #defines in qcommon/q_shared.h with
information appropriate for your project.

## Standalone game licensing

While a lot of work has been put into ioquake3 that you can benefit from free
of charge, it does not mean that you have no obligations to fulfill. Please be
aware that as soon as you start distributing your game with an engine based on
our sources we expect you to fully comply with the requirements as stated in
the GPL. That includes making sources and modifications you made to the
ioquake3 engine as well as the game-code used to compile the .qvm files for
the game logic freely available to everyone. Furthermore, note that the "QIIIA
Game Source License" prohibits distribution of mods that are intended to
operate on a version of Q3 not sanctioned by id software:

    "with this Agreement, ID grants to you the non-exclusive and limited right
    to distribute copies of the Software ... for operation only with the full
    version of the software game QUAKE III ARENA"

This means that if you're creating a standalone game, you cannot use said
license on any portion of the product. As the only other license this code has
been released under is the GPL, this is the only option.

This does NOT mean that you cannot market this game commercially. The GPL does
not prohibit commercial exploitation and all assets (e.g. textures, sounds,
maps) created by yourself are your property and can be sold like every other
game you find in stores.


## PNG support

ioquake3 supports the use of PNG (Portable Network Graphic) images as
textures. It should be noted that the use of such images in a map will
result in missing placeholder textures where the map is used with the id
Quake 3 client or earlier versions of ioquake3.

Recent versions of GtkRadiant and q3map2 support PNG images without
modification. However GtkRadiant is not aware that PNG textures are supported
by ioquake3. To change this behaviour open the file 'q3.game' in the 'games'
directory of the GtkRadiant base directory with an editor and change the
line:

    texturetypes="tga jpg"

to

    texturetypes="tga jpg png"

Restart GtkRadiant and PNG textures are now available.

## Building with MinGW for pre Windows XP

IPv6 support requires a header named "wspiapi.h" to abstract away from
differences in earlier versions of Windows' IPv6 stack. There is no MinGW
equivalent of this header and the Microsoft version is obviously not
redistributable, so in its absence we're forced to require Windows XP.
However if this header is acquired separately and placed in the qcommon/
directory, this restriction is lifted.


# Contributing

Please send all patches to bugzilla (https://bugzilla.icculus.org), or as a GitHub pull request and
submit your patch there.

The focus for ioq3 is to develop a stable base suitable for further development
and provide players with the same Quake 3 experience they've had for years.

We do have graphical improvements with the new renderer, but they are off by default.
See opengl2-readme.md for more information.

# Building Official Installers

We need help getting automated installers on all the platforms that ioquake3
supports. We don't necessarily care about all the installers being identical,
but we have some general guidelines:

  * Please include the id patch pk3s in your installer, which are available
    from http://ioquake3.org/patch-data/ subject to agreement to the id
    EULA. Your installer shall also ask the user to agree to this EULA (which
    is in the /web/include directory for your convenience) and subsequently
    refuse to continue the installation of the patch pk3s and pak0.pk3 if they
    do not.

  * Please don't require pak0.pk3, since not everyone using the engine
    plans on playing Quake 3 Arena on it. It's fine to (optionally) assist the
    user in copying the file or tell them how.

  * It is fine to just install the binaries without requiring id EULA agreement,
    providing pak0.pk3 and the patch pk3s are not referred to or included in the
    installer.

  * Please include at least a libSDL2 so/dylib/dll on every platform.

  * Please include an OpenAL so/dylib/dll, since every platform should be using
    it by now.

  * Please be prepared to alter your installer on the whim of the maintainers.

  * Your installer will be mirrored to an "official" directory, thus making it
    a done deal.
