/**************************************************************
 * Original:
 * Patrick Powell Tue Apr 11 09:48:21 PDT 1995
 * A bombproof version of doprnt (dopr) included.
 * Sigh.  This sort of thing is always nasty do deal with.  Note that
 * the version here does not include floating point...
 *
 * snprintf() is used instead of sprintf() as it does limit checks
 * for string length.  This covers a nasty loophole.
 *
 * The other functions are there to prevent NULL pointers from
 * causing nast effects.
 *
 * More Recently:
 *  Brandon Long <blong@fiction.net> 9/15/96 for mutt 0.43
 *  This was ugly.  It is still ugly.  I opted out of floating point
 *  numbers, but the formatter understands just about everything
 *  from the normal C string format, at least as far as I can tell from
 *  the Solaris 2.5 printf(3S) man page.
 *
 *  Brandon Long <blong@fiction.net> 10/22/97 for mutt 0.87.1
 *    Ok, added some minimal floating point support, which means this
 *    probably requires libm on most operating systems.  Don't yet
 *    support the exponent (e,E) and sigfig (g,G).  Also, fmtint()
 *    was pretty badly broken, it just wasn't being exercised in ways
 *    which showed it, so that's been fixed.  Also, formated the code
 *    to mutt conventions, and removed dead code left over from the
 *    original.  Also, there is now a builtin-test, just compile with:
 *           gcc -DTEST_SNPRINTF -o snprintf snprintf.c -lm
 *    and run snprintf for results.
 * 
 *  Thomas Roessler <roessler@guug.de> 01/27/98 for mutt 0.89i
 *    The PGP code was using unsigned hexadecimal formats. 
 *    Unfortunately, unsigned formats simply didn't work.
 *
 *  Michael Elkins <me@cs.hmc.edu> 03/05/98 for mutt 0.90.8
 *    The original code assumed that both snprintf() and vsnprintf() were
 *    missing.  Some systems only have snprintf() but not vsnprintf(), so
 *    the code is now broken down under HAVE_SNPRINTF and HAVE_VSNPRINTF.
 *
 *  Andrew Tridgell (tridge@samba.org) Oct 1998
 *    fixed handling of %.0f
 *    added test for HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE
 *
 *  Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu> 2000-08-26
 *    fixed return value to comply with C99
 *    fixed handling of snprintf(NULL, ...)
 *
 *  Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@arsdigita.com> 2000-11-04
 *    include <config.h> instead of "config.h".
 *    moved TEST_SNPRINTF stuff out of HAVE_SNPRINTF ifdef.
 *    include <stdio.h> for NULL.
 *    added support and test cases for long long.
 *    don't declare argument types to (v)snprintf if stdarg is not used.
 *    use int instead of short int as 2nd arg to va_arg.
