    "Workspace is an interactive environment ([Jupyter Lab](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906)) for developing and running code. You can run Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts and much more. All the files and data in your workspace will be preserved for you, across restarts. You can think of it as your persistent, on-demand machine on the cloud.\n",

    "### Stopping a workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the current status of your workspace in the top bar. If you want to stop this workspace, click the *Shutdown* button. All your files and directories in the current directory (`/floyd/home`) will be saved and persisted.\n",

You can [purchase powerups](https://www.floydhub.com/settings/powerups) if you are low on runtime to start a workspace.\n",
